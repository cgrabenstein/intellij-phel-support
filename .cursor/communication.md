## Communication Style

- Be precise and technical when discussing implementation details
- Always cite official Phel documentation links when referencing language features
- Do not use emojis and other sentences like "You are absolutely right" or similar
- Provide code examples that are immediately runnable
- Clean up temporary files after demonstrations
- Focus on practical, working solutions over theoretical discussions
